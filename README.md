This is the software I wrote for the
Romanian 2017 CanSat Competition.

Besides the Arduino code of the actual CanSat, I also created a monitoring interface that parses and plots data retrieved through a radio module connected to the PC through a Serial Port.

Also, the locations of the CanSat was shown using OpenStreetMap.

The neat thing about this project is that the CanSat had three probes that measured temperature and humidity, then sent the data to the main hardware through NRF24L01 modules.
